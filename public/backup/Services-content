Services

As an independent consultant inspired by the Greek ideal of Irini (peace), I empower leaders and organizations to thrive through transitions and achieve lasting success. My approach combines entrepreneurial thinking with evidence-based behavioral science, delivering meaningful results through personalized coaching and strategic advisory services.

h2: Leadership Coaching
I've learned that a business can grow only as much as its leaders. My coaching programs are designed to help executives align their actions with the strategic outcomes most critical to their organization's long-term success.

Each coaching journey is tailored to your specific challenges, focusing on three guiding principles: perspective, courage and integrity.
