About Me

Professional Experience & Mission
I believe leadership is about transformation. My mission is to help others cultivate clarity and self-mastery so they can lead with purpose, navigate uncertainty, and create lasting impact. This transformative approach requires individuals to push beyond their comfort zones and inspire change toward an improved state through broader perspective, courage, and integrity. I believe when leaders understand the most unpredictable part of their organization, the human system, they can create extraordinary impact and growth.

Button: View My Transformation

As an entrepreneur and product leader with fifteen years of experience building and growing companies, I've consistently developed a coaching leadership style throughout my professional journey. My professional experiences in healthcare and technology have deepened my understanding of complex leadership in dynamic, rapidly transforming industries. My exploration of crypto and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) expanded my perspective on governance models, and ultimately reinforced my core belief that leadership fundamentally connects an organization's human, technical, and operational systems—even in these decentralized environments.

As an executive coach and organizational consultant, I help leaders broaden their self- and situational awareness to successfully start and grow businesses. My approach synthesizes strategic business insights with deep knowledge of human behavior, while always prioritizing data privacy and ethical transparency.

Education
My interdisciplinary background and commitment to continuous learning enables me to bridge business strategy, human behavior, and technology implementation to enhance decision-making and collaboration across multiple business domains.

I earned a Bachelor of Science from Syracuse University, where I pursued a double major in Entrepreneurship Emerging Enterprises and Finance with a minor in Psychology. I expanded my technical knowledge through full-stack web development and design bootcamps, gaining critical insights into how tech teams build and operate. My professional development continued with a Product Owner certification from Scrum.org, a Sales Growth certification from eCornell focused on strategy, and a Human Systems Certification from Grinnell Leadership formalizing my interest in neurobiology and human behavior.

Self-Mastery and Honoring Heritage
My Greek, Italian, and Irish heritage has shaped my values and approach to leadership development, with each culture contributing rich traditions and a strong work ethic through my immigrant ancestors. After losing my father and paternal grandfather in 2022, my Greek heritage has taken on deeper significance. While Greece is often celebrated as a beautiful vacation destination, my family's history there is one of perseverance through adversity. My great-grandparents endured the hardships of World War II and the Greek Civil War—times of occupation, starvation, and struggle for freedom.

My grandparents emigrated to Canada and the United States in search of new opportunities. Although I never knew my great-grandmothers Zoe (Greek for "life") and Irini ("peace"), I carry their names with me. Their strong female legacies inspire my work. A life of peace isn't about avoiding conflict, but about building resilience and setting boundaries. This peace enables us to navigate challenging circumstances with harmony and grace—creating the level of ease that leaders and organizations need to succeed and grow.
